a. How does the linear regression approach to the problem fare?
The linear regression approach 

b. Task 1: Compare and contrast L2 Loss vs LogLoss.
LogLoss is heavily concentrated around 0 ~ 0.1. This indicates improved accuracy compared to L2 Loss. 

c. Task 2: Explain how the logistic regression fares compared to the linear regression.
The logistic regression certainly outdoes the linear regression. 


d. Task 3: Here, just report the best values you can achieve for AUC/accuracy and what hyperparameters you used to get them.
