Therefore I am still grasping and evaluating if this is a practical direction and remain \nopen to changing my project topic if this turns out to be too ambitious.   \n    After reading about this topic on http://nilearn.github.io, an online database containing tutorials for machine learning \nfor neuroimaging, I became interested in using convolutional neural nets in supervised learning to accomplish either a binary \nclassification of the brain state (at rest or engaged), or prediction of a clinical score. This would require \naccess to a clearly labeled dataset of fMRI, for which openneuro.org would be helpful, and learning to use the nilearn library.\n"
