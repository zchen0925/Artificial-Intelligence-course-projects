Exercise 1:
We want the machine learned model to: identify Gmail emails that are important to users

Exercise 2:
Our ideal outcome is: to identify and label emails that warrant user's time, attention, and/or action.

Exercise 3:
Success Metrics: If the emails labeled as important by the model are indeed important, success metrics will 
include: user reading the email soon, user replying to the email, the amount of time user spends in/interacting with the email.	


Key results for the success metrics: 
	of the emails that the user read before others (given read priority to), the model marks at least 70% of them as important

	of the emails that the user interacts with significantly (composing a reply, clicking a link, or downloading an attachment, etc), the model marks at least 70% of them as important

	the user reads 95% of the labeled emails before they read other unlabeled ones.

	the user interacts more significantly with 95% of the labeled emails than they do with unlabeled emails.


ML model is deemed a failure if:
	The labeled emails receive no read priority / no greater amount of interaction than the unlabeled emails. This would mean the ML model failed to distinguish the real important ones.


Exercise 4:
	The output from ML will be a list of labels that indicate which emails are important.

	The output will be defined as a label resulting from a computed probability of the email being important by the model. If the probability is greater than 0.90, the label will be created.
