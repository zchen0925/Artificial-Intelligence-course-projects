    "Introspection is a subjective process for humans, and it is only capable of informing so much. In Cognitive Psychology, we are learning that cognition is broadly created from bottom-up and top-down processes, firstly perceiving the environment, and secondly and often simultaneously imposing our knowledge and experiences on our interpretations of the external and running internal thoughts. A lot of intuition and subconcious components in cognition would be undetectable to introspection.\n",
    "I would think that it can be useful in informing us about some overarching themese in cognitive processes. "
