    "Introspection is a subjective process for humans, and it is only capable of informing so much. In Cognitive Psychology, we are learning that cognition is broadly created from bottom-up and top-down processes, simultaneously handling and filtering many stimuli before they reach consciousness. These automatic components of cognition would be undetectable to introspection and thus cannot inform efforts in AI problem-solving. An example can be that in solving a problem, humans (subconsciously) choose to attend to certain features while ignoring others. If only introspection is used in abstracting how we came to the solution, AI would miss out on how we pre-filter the information to focus on the useful features and be lost in a sea of information. Another broad idea in cognitive psychology is how we virtually always impose prior knowledge and experience on our current situation. This top-down process would be pretty hard to capture and translate to a machine using introspection, since computers need to be programs to glean information from past experiences and \"learn\". So personally I think that we need something that is more objective and well-defined than just introspection to make problem-solving practical for machines. Cognitive tests and experienments can zero-in on what happens under the hood in human thought processes. Nonetheless, introspection tells us how we prioritize certain information and make general judgements, these principles can serve as a foundation to build AI algorithms heuristics."

    "I formulated traveling salesman as a local search problem. Each city is coded as an integer, and the distances between any two cities (random integer between 0 and 20) is stored as a key-value pair in a dictionary. The problem starts with a initial state, which is a random complete path. From here, the problem allows for actions that swap the order of visit between any two cities excluding the first and last in the circuit. It is required that any state starts at city 0, hits all cities, and returns to 0. At any state, The total travelled distance for the current state is calculated by adding up the pair-wise distances in the circuit. Pair-wise distances are found in the map, and it is assumed that distances are symmetric. We'd want to optimize and find the shortest possible path, so actions that decreases the total distance of the current state are defined to have a higher value."

    "With this formulation of tsp, hill-climbing and simulated annealing both finds solutions that are much shorter in distance than the initial path. Their solutions are usually pretty comparable - sometimes hill-climbing finds a better one, sometimes simulated-annealing does. I did notice that simulated annealing takes much longer to run especially on the larger configurations. With the exception ofextreme scenarios where being willing to travel to further away cities will lead to saving great distances later on in the path, I think in traveling salesman problem simulated annealing probably don't have much advantage over simple hill-climbing especially after weighing the costs. It makes sense to always pick your next states that is more advantageous (shorter distance)."
